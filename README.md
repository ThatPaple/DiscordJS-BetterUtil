<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Most of my personal bots rely on the ``Util.splitMessage()`` function. Recently, the function itself got deprecated and later, it will be removed. As such, I plan to maintain it myself, with future changes to the function itself. Eventually, I'd like to create a whole new utility system to replace the one provided within Discord.js.
